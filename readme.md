# Event Manager Company: Software QA Analyst/Developer Onboarding Assignment

## Reflection

This assignment has been an incredibly challenging yet valuable learning experience. I encountered several technical issues, particularly with debugging and ensuring that all components of the project worked in harmony. One of the main hurdles I faced was resolving authentication issues and ensuring proper communication between the API and database. While I followed the video guide closely, there were discrepancies between what worked for me locally versus what was expected. This led to a lot of troubleshooting and frustration.

Though I wasn't able to fully resolve all issues before the deadline, I did manage to learn a lot throughout the process. I gained insights into Docker deployment, API interactions, and testing strategies. Despite the difficulties, the experience reinforced the importance of detailed documentation and incremental problem-solving. Moving forward, I plan to continue refining my code and improve my debugging process, as this assignment has shown me how easy it is to encounter roadblocks. I also recognize the importance of patience and persistence when tackling complex tasks.

Overall, while I’m not entirely satisfied with my progress at this point, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of technical development and the collaborative challenges that arise when working with complex code.
